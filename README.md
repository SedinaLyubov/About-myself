# Обо мне
## About myself

I want to write about myself in English language because it's interesting. Maybe i do some grammar mistakes, because it's first text about myself in english language. 

Let me tell you something interesting about me. I like education. I like to study something new about inventions, programms, developments. Also i like hikings, fishing and to explore nature. I like to help people. I like different cuisine from all over the world. I like to study it and psychology. 

What else can i add?
----


I believe in the bright future. I think that our dreams must be reality. I believe in love.
Love is not ellusion. Love helps to develop yourself.
These were my thoughts.

Believe in yourself my reader and do something bright for people.
